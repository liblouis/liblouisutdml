@section Dividing a Book Into Volumes

The multi-volume feature is triggered by the configuration setting 
@code{volumeSem filename}. Filename is the name of a semantic file which 
assigns semantic actions and styles to xml tags for the purpose of 
interpreting the UTD protions of the document and using the structure of 
the document to divide the output into volumes. This feature operates in 
two passes. In the first, the UTD portion of the document is created. In 
the second the book is actually divided into volumes and each volume is 
output as a separate file. These files have the extensions .001 .002 
etc. added afgter the original filename given for output. If this 
filename had an extension, the volume numbers are simply added onto the 
end.
