Infile must be a Microsoft Word file. The script first calls the
`antiword' program, so you must have this installed on your machine.
`antiword' is called with `-x db', which causes the output to be in
docbook format. This is piped to `xml2brl'. The output file from
`xml2brl' contains much of the formatting, including emphasis, of the
word file.
